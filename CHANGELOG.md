## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Removed

- Remove unused dataRamByteEnable parameter
  (IMPORTANT: requires changes to existing integrations)

### Changed

### Fixed

- Add the missing comma in the port list of the blackbox model of
  hpdcache_sram_wbyteenable_ecc_1rw

## [6.1.0] 2026-10-16

### Added

- Add Support read-only configuration (only read/CMO requests accepted by the cache)
- Recover from uncorrectable error when cache is WT by invalidating the cacheline

### Changed

- README and CONTRIBUTING improved (guidelines for contributors)
- Process cacheline-based CMOs directly in the cache's pipeline

### Fixed

- Fix FSM transition in the error controller (when error correction is enabled)
- Fix missing set of the fetch bit in the dir to 0 in case of uncacheable access

## [6.0.0] 2026-03-13

### Added

- Error correction and detection mechanisms for bit-flips in dir and data SRAMs
- New parameters: eccEn, eccScrubberEn
- Vendorized lowRISC OpenTitan subdirectory with ECC primitives and generators

## [5.2.0] 2026-03-13

### Added

- Testbench: add sequence that reads trace file from QEMU execution
- Testbench: add direct mapped configuration and validate it in the CI
- Add plugin for QEMU to generate memory access traces
- Add cache invalidation signal in the memory response interface

### Changed

- Enable concurrent read and write if they target different banks
- Optimize write byte enable logic for timing towards data SRAMs
- Improve wake-up logic in the RTAB for requests waiting for a refill

### Fixed

- Prevent invalidations to go into the uncached handler (on OpenPiton platform)
- Correctly support direct mapped configuration of the cache

## [5.1.0] 2025-07-02

### Added

- New lowLatency parameter: When enabled, load requests have a latency of 1
  cycle. When disabled, load requests have a latency 2 cycles. This may improve
  the throughput on some access patterns because it reduces port conflicts
  between loads and stores.
- New coalescing buffer for write misses. On write misses, the write data is
  stored in a dedicated buffer, and coalesced when the refill response arrives
  before writing it into the cache.
- Heuristic mechanism to reduce the latency of flush operations. The cache
  stores both the min and max index of dirty cachelines and perform the flush
  only on within that boundary.

### Removed

### Changed

- Use RTAB to drain pipeline upon UC/AMO requests. On a UC/AMO request, the
  cache puts the request into the RTAB, and waits for all transactions into the
  pipeline to be completed before replaying the UC/AMO request.

### Fixed

- Missing reset of some registers in the uncached requests handler.

## [5.0.1] 2025-01-30

This releases include some bugfixes and optimizations.

### Added

- Support responses for CMO operations when ``need_rsp`` in the request is set
- Support not-power-of-two number of entries in the Flush controller

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fix implementation of the data merge logic in the write buffer to improve the area
- Fix assertions syntax
- Fix CMO flushes shall unset the dirty bit in the cache directory
- Fix handling of bus errors on write misses
- Fix prefetch requests shall update PLRU bits
- Fix initialization of the CMO handler flush request valid register

## [5.0.0] 2024-10-10

The major modification in this release is the support of the write-back (WB) policy (in
addition to the write-through (WT) policy). The cache can either implement one of these
policies or both in a per-cacheline basis.

### Added

- Support of the WB policy.
- Configuration parameters to choose between WT or WB, or both, at synthesis time.
- Validation testbench compatible to Verilator.
- Add a write-policy hint field in the request to select between WT and WB, dynamically.

### Removed

- WbufSendFeedThrough parameter removed

### Changed

- Arbitration between cacheable and uncacheable memory requests is done inside the
  HPDcache. The memory interface implements 5 channels, instead of 10.
- The CMO type is into the operation field of the request (instead of the size field).
- Select the victim cacheline at cache miss time (before was done on refill time). The
  slot is pre-allocated and written by the miss handler when the refill response arrives.

### Fixed

## [4.0.0] 2024-08-20

The major modification in this release is the new scheme to set parameters of the HPDcache

### Added

- Add utility macros to define the types in the interface of the HPDcache.
- Add scripts for code static check (lint)
- Add new User Guide document in reStructuredText format

### Removed

### Changed

- Pass configuration parameters through the top module of the HPDcache instead of
  defining them in a package. This allows different instances of the HPDcache to have
  different parameters.
- Add round-robin priority arbiter in the write-buffer to select an entry to send.
- Add fix-priority arbiter in the write-buffer to select a free entry.
- Make AXI transactions modifiable by default

### Fixed

- Fix some synthesis warnings

## [3.1.0] 2024-04-20

### Added

- Add support for pseudo-random (using a LFSR) algorithm for the victim selection
- Add support for the OpenPiton Cache-Coherent Network-on-Chip
- Add support for full-associative, direct-mapped or single-entry MSHR

### Removed

### Changed

- Cache directory valid bits are relocated in the Tag RAM
- Modify the arbitration between the different sources of requests (refill is now prioritary)
- Add feedthrough (optional) fifo in both wbuf and refill handler
- Disable assertions during reset
- Modify write buffer microarchitecture to improve both area and performance

### Fixed

- Fix support for AMOs when using a 32-bit request interface

## [3.0.0] 2023-10-08

### Added

- Add support for virtually-indexed addressing

### Fixed

- Fix forwarding logic of uncacheable Icache response in the cva6 cache subsystem.
- Fix wrong mask signal when implementing the MSHR in registers

## [2.1.0] - 2023-09-25

### Added

- Add additional configuration to implement MSHR in registers (when the number
  of entries is low)

### Fixed

- Fix cache data SRAM chip-select generation when word width is different than
  64 bits (e.g. 32 bits)

## [2.0.0] - 2023-09-18

### Added

- Add parameters in the HPDcache module to define the types of interfaces to
  the memory
- Add helper verilog header file with macros to ease the type definition of
  interfaces to the memory
- Add new event signals in the HPDCache top module
- Add generic single-port RAM macros with byte-enable signals
- Add parameters in the package to choose between RAM macros implementing
  byte-enable or bitmask for the different RAMs instances
- Add additional assertions to verify parameters
- Add additional configuration signal to inhibit write coalescing in the write
  buffer

### Removed

- Remove base_id ports in the HPDCache top module
- Remove nettype (wire,var) in ports as it looks like is badly supported in
  some cases by some simulation tools

### Changed

- Split the hpdcache_pkg into: (1) the hpdcache_pkg contains internally defined
  parameters; (2) a new hpdcache_params_pkg that defines user parameters
- New selection policy of ready requests in the replay table. It gives priority
  to requests in the same linked list.
- The write buffer now accepts writes from requesters in a pending slot when it
  is waiting for the internal arbiter to forward the data to the NoC.

### Fixed

- Correctly support HPDCACHE_ACCESS_WORDS=1
- Correctly support HPDCACHE_ACCESS_WORDS=HPDCACHE_CL_WORDS
- Fix width of the nlines count register in the HW memory prefetcher.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-02-22

### Added
- Initial release to the OpenHW Group
